# renderer
Basic 3D rendering components I have made from scratch with OpenGL. Currently, this is able to generate and render meshes for parameterized shapes in 3D. The parameterization must be explicity defined in main.cpp, but I plan to change this.

**To compile:** In CMakeLists, make sure to include a path to "lib" folder from [this repository](https://github.com/ebajec/linear-algebra) as an include directoryâ€” this uses the matrix class I made there.  Also, make sure that GLEW and GLFW are installed and the root directories are specified in CMakeLists.txt.

**How to use:** Once the program has opened, type "launch" in the console window to launch the scene. There are a few other commands, and I will probably add more.  To control the camera, use WASD and the mouse.  There is currently an odd bug which causes the orientation of the controls to go crazy.  This is very bad on linux for some reason.  

*close:* closes the scene being rendered.

*exit:* exits the program.
